Toy Android application for learning Android application development.

This application "Debug Toy" contains my various efforts to learn how to create
and maintain Android applications.

The application is organized into "pages", with each page serving a different
purpose.

The first page is the "debug" page. This page has a text box for user input and
a large text box for command output. Entering "help" will list the registered
commands.

The second page is a crude particle simulation. This page is meant to
demonstrate using native C++ code with the Java application.

The third page has nothing on it. This will change once I find something to
implement.

WARNING: This application may be a security risk if used on actual devices, as
it allows arbitrary shell execution, even though the application's Android user
(hopefully) lacks access to do anything destructive.
